                        Before my workterm, I knew close to nothing about the workflows of software engineers. During my workterms at Pixieset,
                        I learned about how tasks are distributed amongst developers, concepts on sprints and its retrospective & planning, and
                        the procedures before a task is deployed including PR reviews and feedbacks.

                    <div class="textHolder">
                        Workterms offer co-op students an opportunity to have a close look at modern days' software engineer's work flow and some
                        hands-on experience with the tools they use. Tools such as Jira, retroIO, TestRail, and git management program such as bitbucket and github.
                        One of the most valuable knowledge I learned was git and task deployment flow which will be discussed in more details.
