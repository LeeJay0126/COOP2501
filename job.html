                        <p class="stepTexts">Personal projects are a good indicators that you put in the time to
                            self-learn and also a good way to practice the skills you have in your bag. I personally
                            learn the most by working a project as I would brainstorm how I would implement a function
                            or UI design. From an interviewer perspective, projects are better indicators showing your
                            understanding of a concept or a language than reading couple lines of what you've learned in
                            school.

                        <p class="stepTexts">You will need to dedicate your CV and resume for a position, but I'd
                            recommend having a template ready for both of them per position type you are applying to. If
                            you are applying for QA, SET, and Dev position, You will have different experience and
                            skills to include in your application. Prepare a template ahead of time and that will save
                            you a lot of time when you start applying.

                            your co-op jobs! Langara College's C3 is a great place you can apply for jobs, but I highly
                            recommend you take a look at other popular job listing sites such as indeed, glassdoor, and
                            ca.talent.com.
                            Not all co-op job listings are on C3, you should absolutely apply to as many positions as
                            you can.

                            students, you will want to stand out and get selected for the next round of interview. Write
                            a detailed cover letter dedicated for the company you are applying to in a formal manner. If
                            you need help with writing cover letters, you should reach out to Langara College co-op

                        <p class="stepTexts">Many students may know to write a dedicated coverletter for a position if
                            you are serious about them. One thing most students overlook is your resume should just as
                            be dedicated to a role as your cover letter. You will be (ideally) looking for a position
                            that requires different skills and programming languages. Read the position's candidate
                            expectations and highlight what they are looking for in you in your resume.

                        <p class="stepTexts">Take your time to study the company you are applying to. You obviously know

                            how they work. Prepare some unique positive insights on their product and the company.
